    <p class="pullquote"><strong>Spatial Composition</strong> is the first acrylic painting completed by <em>Burcu
        Yasemin Turkay</em>. The work takes its inspiration from dazzle painting which was a technique extensively used
      during World War I as a camouflage strategy for ships. The patterns intend to make it difficult to estimate a
      ship’s heading and speed, thus misleading the enemy about a ship’s exact location. Likewise, the painting aims to
      create a space of confusion and disorientation, questioning the spatial qualities that guide people to perceive
      and understand space.</p>

    <p class="pullquote">The bright colors of each surface are referring to colors preferred by Piet Mondrian who had an
      enormous influence on the art and architecture of the twentieth century. His colors on two-dimensional canvas
      space were brought to life in a three-dimensional built space. These colors further play with vision and the
      understanding of depth, and hence how people construct the space around them in their minds.</p>
